Delivery Manager Dashboard - Implementation Plan
Overview
Building a comprehensive, professional Delivery Manager dashboard for Mallify platform using React. The dashboard will provide complete control over driver management, delivery operations, logistics oversight, analytics, and financial management.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

This is a large-scale dashboard application with multiple interconnected features. The implementation will create:

15+ React components organized in a modular structure
Modern UI with professional design using gradients, animations, and responsive layouts
Mock data for demonstration purposes (will need backend integration later)
Routing system for navigation between different sections
